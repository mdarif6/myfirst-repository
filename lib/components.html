          The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets

          droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors
          or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are
          within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a
